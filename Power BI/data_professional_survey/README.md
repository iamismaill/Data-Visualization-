## Data Professional Servey 

This project presents an interactive visual representation of the survey results on data professionals' job titles, salaries, and other relevant information. Using Power BI, I created dashboards that focus on specific aspects of the survey, such as salary ranges, job satisfaction, and career aspirations.

The dashboards include various types of visualizations, such as bar charts, pie charts, and maps, that provide a clear and concise summary of the survey data. Users can explore the data by filtering it based on job titles, salaries, and other variables.

Throughout the project, I learned valuable skills in using Power BI to create insightful data visualizations. This project serves as a testament to my proficiency in leveraging Power BI to deliver meaningful insights from complex datasets.

Overall, this portfolio project offers an excellent opportunity to explore the survey results and gain a better understanding of the data professional industry's job titles, salaries, and other critical metrics.
